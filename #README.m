%% TODOs
% - also search for 'FIXME' for issues to be fixed
% - use 'sim scale' to norm all other scales
%     - regularize states and inputs and their respective weights, scale models and track --> allows easy adaption to miniature and full-sized vehicle
%     - scale vehicle size (length/width) for correct vehicle avoidance
% - implement usage of differing models for simulation/controller
% - SCR Paper: check scripts con2vert etc.
% - geometrical vehicle scaling is missing: values hard-coded in 'vehicle' config, better should be part of vehicle model parameters
