- use "sim scale" to norm all other scales
    - regularize states and inputs and their respective weights, scale models and track --> allows easy adaption to miniature and full-sized vehicle
    - scale vehicle size (length/width) for correct vehicle avoidance
- implement usage of differing models for simulation/controller
- SCR Paper: check scripts con2vert etc.
