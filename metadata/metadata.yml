name: Sequential Convex Programming Methods for Real-time Optimal Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Vehicle Racing
description: We present a real-time-capable Model Predictive Controller (MPC)
based on a non-linear single-track vehicle model and Pacejkaâ€™s
magic tire formula for autonomous racing applications. After 
formulating the general non-convex trajectory optimization 
problem, the model is linearized around estimated operating 
points and the constraints are convexified using the Sequential
Convex Programming (SCP) method. We use two different methods
to convexify the non-convex track constraints, namely Sequential
Linearization (SL) and Sequential Convex Restriction (SCR).
SL, a method of relaxing the constraints, was introduced in our
previous paper. SCR, a method of restricting the constraints,
is introduced in this paper. We show the application of SCR to
autonomous racing and prove that it does not interfere with
recursive feasibility. We compare the predicted trajectory
quality of the non-linear single-track model with the linear
double integrator model from our previous paper. The MPC
performance is evaluated on a scaled version of the Hockenheimring
racing track. We show that an MPC with SCR yields faster lap times
than an MPC with SL - for race starts as well as flying laps -
while still being real-time capable. A video showing the results
is available at \url{https://youtu.be/21iETsolCNQ}.
