name: Sequential Convex Programming Methods for Real-time Optimal Trajectory Planning
  in Autonomous Vehicle Racing
description: Optimization problems for trajectory planning in autonomous vehicle racing
  are characterized by their nonlinearity and nonconvexity. Instead of solving these
  optimization problems, usually a convex approximation is solved instead to achieve
  a high update rate. We present a real-time-capable model predictive control (MPC)
  trajectory planner based on a nonlinear single-track vehicle model and Pacejka's
  magic tire formula for autonomous vehicle racing. After formulating the general
  nonconvex trajectory optimization problem, we form a convex approximation using
  sequential convex programming (SCP). The state of the art convexifies track constraints
  using sequential linearization (SL), which is a method of relaxing the constraints.
  Solutions to the relaxed optimization problem are not guaranteed to be feasible
  in the nonconvex optimization problem. We propose sequential convex restriction
  (SCR) as a method to convexify track constraints. SCR guarantees that resulting
  solutions are feasible in the nonconvex optimization problem. We show recursive
  feasibility of solutions to the restricted optimization problem. The MPC is evaluated
  on a scaled version of the Hockenheimring racing track in simulation. The results
  show that an MPC using SCR yields faster lap times than an MPC using SL, while still
  being real-time capable.
